SwingTake

Count beats, not steps...

This is a little app I'm making to solve a problem of mine: how to distribute the takings for my Swing Dance venue fast,
so I can get back to dancing!

The wiring & styling aren't finished yet, but there are Jasmine tests for the JS model that does the processing.

It's currently deployed on Heroku, so you can see it!

(to see the Jasmine tests, hit http://glowing-beach-7327.heroku.com/ci )

If you run a swing venue, and are interested in using this at your venue, please get in touch :)
